 ## Additional information:

 The game choses a random phrase at the beginning of each game. It makes sure that the same phrase doesn't get chosen two times in a row. The keyboard functionality of the game also checks to make sure the only keys detected are actual letters. Additionally, it checks to make sure the game is in play before it starts accepting input. The game also gives the player a second and a bit to see the completed phrases before displaying the game over screen.
